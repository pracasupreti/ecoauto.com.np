<h1>Derry EM7 and EV7 Features & Specifications</h1>
<p>These electric vehicles are acceptable for Nepalese roads. They have ample clearance for the Nepalese road as well, high enough to deal with poor road conditions and road portholes. The EV7 has a range of 158 kilometers, whereas the EM7 has a range of 182 kilometers.</p>

<p>The EM7’s solar roof appears to provide some additional range. These estimates, however, fail to hold up when put to the test on the Nepalese highway. If driven carefully, both of these electric cars seem to provide a range of 210KM mileage in a single charge.</p>

<p>Both the models have features like EPS, Power Window, Central Lock, Alloy Wheel, Touch Screen, Hill Assist, Spare Tires etc. </p>
